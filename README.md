# CANable-MKS
MKS CANable firmware and schematic are open source.

## MKS CANable V1.0
**MKS CANable V1.0 module** is an upgraded version of CANable, which adopts TJA1051T/3, a highly integrated chip with interface between controller area network (can) protocol controller and physical two-wire can bus. It is very suitable for product debugging, can bus control and high-speed can Application in automobile industry.

**MKS CANable Pro V1.0 module** is the upgraded version of MKS CANable V1.0 module, which adopts ADM3053BRWZ, a highly integrated fully isolated chip with 2.5KV rms signal and power isolation function. Under the premise of high transmission rate and high operation stability, MKS CANable Pro V1.0 module has stronger anti-interference ability, which is very suitable for industrial debugging or motor application.
